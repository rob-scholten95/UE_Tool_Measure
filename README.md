# Unreal Engine 
# Tool_Measure
 
A project with multiple ways of measuring in playmode with debug lines and math functions. 

Supports the following features:
- Line mode: Simply measures a spline segment from point A to point B and returns the length
- Surface mode: User can create a 4-point polygon in any shape and it returns the length of each edge, the total surface area of the shape, the angles of every point and the midpoint of the polygon.

Future Additions:
Path mode: The user can draw a line consisting of multiple points and can adjust the tangents on it. Returns the length of the edges and the total length.
Polygon mode: User can draw a polygon on which they can add multiple points and manipulate them on runtime. Returns same products as the surface mode.
